# ReadWorldDefi - Tokenized Multi-Asset Management Platform

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized platform for tokenizing and trading real-world assets such as real estate, art, and commodities. Built on blockchain technology, it allows for fractional ownership of high-value assets, increasing liquidity and accessibility for investors. The platform is implemented using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Features

- Multi-asset tokenization (real estate, art, commodities, etc.)
- Fractional ownership of high-value assets
- Decentralized trading platform
- Smart contract-based asset management
- User-friendly interface for asset owners and investors
- Regulatory compliance tools
- Integration with external oracles for asset valuation

## Technology Stack

- Smart Contracts: Clarity (for Stacks blockchain)

## Smart Contract Functions

The core functionality is implemented in a Clarity smart contract, which includes:

### Public Functions

1. `create-asset`: Create a new tokenized asset
2. `transfer`: Transfer asset tokens between users
3. `set-contract-owner`: Change the contract owner

### Read-Only Functions

1. `is-valid-asset-id`: Check if an asset ID is valid
2. `get-asset-details`: Retrieve details of a specific asset
3. `get-balance`: Get the balance of a specific asset for a user

## Setup and Deployment

1. Install the Stacks CLI and set up your local development environment.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fhayvy/RealWorldDefi.git
   cd RealWorldDefi
   ```
3. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain:
   ```
   clarinet contract:deploy token
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a New Asset

To create a new tokenized asset, call the `create-asset` function with the following parameters:
- `name`: Asset name (string-ascii, max 64 characters)
- `type`: Asset type (e.g., "Real Estate", "Art", "Commodity")
- `total-supply`: Total supply of tokens for this asset
- `price`: Initial price per token

Example:
```clarity
(contract-call? .token create-asset "Mona Lisa Fraction" "Art" u1000000 u100)
```

### Transferring Asset Tokens

To transfer asset tokens, call the `transfer` function with the following parameters:
- `to`: Recipient's principal
- `asset-id`: ID of the asset to transfer
- `amount`: Amount of tokens to transfer

Example:
```clarity
(contract-call? .token transfer 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM u1 u100)
```

### Checking Asset Details

To check asset details, call the `get-asset-details` function with the asset ID:

Example:
```clarity
(contract-call? .token get-asset-details u1)
```

### Checking User Balance

To check a user's balance for a specific asset, call the `get-balance` function with the user's principal and the asset ID:

Example:
```clarity
(contract-call? .token get-balance 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM u1)
```

## Security Considerations

- Only the contract owner can create new assets.
- Asset transfers are only allowed if the sender has sufficient balance.
- The contract includes checks to prevent common errors, such as transferring to oneself or using invalid asset IDs.
- Regulatory compliance tools are implemented to ensure adherence to relevant laws and regulations.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external oracles for real-time asset valuation
- Implementation of a decentralized exchange for trading asset tokens
- Development of a user-friendly web interface for asset owners and investors
- Addition of more complex financial instruments and derivatives based on the tokenized assets
